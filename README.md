# VIRTUAL-YARDSALE

### DEVELOPMENT STORY
```
The yardsale (or garage-sale, tag-sale, etc.) has long been a staple of many communities, perhaps due to what it offers the neighborhood: a place of coalition and camaraderie, as well as an opportunity to repurpose one's belongings through the structure of a local market. Unfortunately, a global pandemic has rendered most gatherings as unsafe, and in turn, much of the community's social calendar has been put on pause. While we continue to promote the safe and healthy habits of all communities across the world, a Virtual-Yardsale can engage a community safely, from the comfort of one's home, all while maintaining a secure marketplace for buyers and sellers alike. Connecting with our neighbors is the essence of a thriving community, and a thriving community is what we base our own success on. 
```
### DESCRIPTION
```
This application utilizes a series of technologies to navigate users through a online marketplace. A homepage will prompt both sellers to a page through which new items can be posted, and buyers to a page where they can browse all currently-posted items. The application utilizes javascript to route page-visitors, as well as to post and retrieve routing data. Specifically, jQuery was used to dynamiaclly-render a bootstrap layout of all posted items. Seller/Item data is stored in mySQL workbench, and models abstracting this data were created via Sequelize. Finally, the application has the capactity to connect locally, but has been offically deployed through Heroku, found in the link below.
